# ExerciseApp
Currently a WIP, will update soon with more details and a better read me.

## Goal of project:
Make a WinForm app that makes use of a PostgreSQL database to store users exercise information such as workouts, calories burned, weight loss/gain.
Will require cloning the database structure as it currently only runs locally (might in future move to a cloud hosted database).
